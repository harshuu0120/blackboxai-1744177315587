# Study Materials App

## Project Overview
The **Study Materials App** is a platform designed for students to share and access study materials. The application enables users to upload, download, and interact with a diverse range of educational resources, facilitating collaborative learning and knowledge sharing.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/study-materials-app.git
   cd study-materials-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define your MongoDB connection URI:
   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_uri>
   PORT=5000
   ```

## Usage
To start the application, you can use the following command to run both the server and client concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the server on the specified port and the client application.

1. **Visit the API:**
   Once the server is running, you can access the API at: 
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/
   ```

2. **Client Usage:**
   Make sure you navigate to the client directory if specified, and run the client immediately using:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Material Upload:** Users can upload study materials.
- **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for materials.
- **File Handling:** Use of multer for handling file uploads.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** Enables the API to be accessed from various front-end applications.

## Dependencies
The application is built with the following key dependencies:

- **Express**: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **bcryptjs**: Library to hash passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Implementation of JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- **cors**: Middleware to enable CORS in the app.
- **cloudinary**: Cloud storage for media file management.
- **multer**: Middleware for handling multipart/form-data, primarily used for uploading files.
- **dotenv**: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **body-parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.

### Dev Dependencies
- **nodemon**: Monitors for any changes in the source and automatically restarts the server.
- **concurrently**: A utility to run multiple commands concurrently.
